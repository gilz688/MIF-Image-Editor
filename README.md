# MIF Image Editor
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gilz688/MIF-ImageEditor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gilz688/MIF-ImageEditor)


Description:
* This application is an editor for 8-bit images stored in Memory Initialization File Format, which is used within Quartus. The editor is capable of converting common image files such as PNG, GIF and BMP to MIF and vice versa.
* The MIF created using this tool can be used to initialize a memory block on the FPGA and may be loaded into the VGA controller RAM memory.
* I made the old version of this application last year for a Verilog project and it used Swing GUI Widgets. I decided to rewrite the application to learn about JavaFX, Gradle and MVP.
